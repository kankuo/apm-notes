Spring Cloud Sleuth automatically instruments all your Spring applications, so you should not have to do anything to activate it. The instrumentation is added by using a variety of technologies according to the stack that is available. For example, for a servlet web application, we use a Filter, and, for Spring Integration, we use ChannelInterceptors.

You can customize the keys used in span tags. To limit the volume of span data, an HTTP request is, by default, tagged only with a handful of metadata, such as the status code, the host, and the URL. You can add request headers by configuring spring.sleuth.keys.http.headers (a list of header names).

Tags are collected and exported only if there is a Sampler that allows it. By default, there is no such Sampler, to ensure that there is no danger of accidentally collecting too much data without configuring something).
